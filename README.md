## âœ… Code quality

This project uses the following quality tools to maintain consistent codebases:

- [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint), a check style tool to help format our code and make it better for understanding;
- [detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt), a static code analysis tool for Kotlin;
- [kover](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover), a code coverage tool for Kotlin;

Always make sure to run `./gradlew detekt ktlintCheck koverVerify` before opening a pull request to see if you have any code style issues and avoid CI server check errors.
