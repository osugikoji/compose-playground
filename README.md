# Jetpack Compose Playground (Working in Progress üöß)

This repository contains a set of features that attempts to use the latest libraries and tools. Try to follow Android design and development best practices and is intended to be a useful reference for developers.

Each feature has two modules, one originally made with XML and another with Jetpack Compose, so you can see the difference between them and help you learn and understand more about Compose in Android.

The app is currently a work in progress and is not yet available on the Play Store. More features will come out soon!

## ‚úÖ Code quality

This project uses the following quality tools to maintain consistent codebases:

- [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint), a check style tool to help format our code and make it better for understanding;
- [detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt), a static code analysis tool for Kotlin;
- [kover](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover), a code coverage tool for Kotlin;

Always make sure to run `./gradlew detekt ktlintCheck koverVerify` before opening a pull request to see if you have any code style issues and avoid CI server check errors.
